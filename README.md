# 🔐 Tkinter Login & Signup System

A simple, user-friendly desktop GUI application built with **Python's Tkinter**.  
This project features an interactive login and signup interface with basic authentication using a local file-based system (`datasheet.txt`). It's ideal for beginners exploring GUI development and user authentication.

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ Modern GUI with Tkinter
- 🔐 Login and Signup functionality
- 🔁 Password confirmation for new users
- 📁 User data stored in a local text file
- 🛠 Error handling and validation messages
- 🖼️ Custom page design with images

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Tkinter (GUI)
- AST module (for safe data evaluation)
- Messagebox (for alerts)

## 📦 How It Works

- Users **register** with a unique username and password.
- Credentials are stored as a dictionary in `datasheet.txt`.
- On login, credentials are checked and a welcome screen appears on success.
- Input validations and error messages improve usability.

## 🖥️ Screens
