# 🔐 Tkinter Login & Signup System

A simple and user-friendly desktop GUI application built using **Python's Tkinter**.  
This project provides an interactive login and signup interface with basic authentication using a local file-based system (`datasheet.txt`). Ideal for beginners exploring GUI development and user authentication mechanisms.

## 🚀 Features

- ✨ Beautiful GUI using Tkinter
- 🔐 Login and Signup functionality
- 🔁 Password confirmation for new users
- 📁 User data stored securely in a local text file
- 🛠 Error handling and validation messages
- 🖼️ Custom login and signup page design using images

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Tkinter (GUI)
- AST module (for safely evaluating stored data)
- Messagebox (for user-friendly alerts)

## 📦 How It Works

- Users can **register** with a unique username and password.
- Credentials are stored in a dictionary format in `datasheet.txt`.
- On login, credentials are matched and a new screen appears upon success.
- Basic input validations and error messages enhance usability.

## 🖥️ Screens

- ✅ Login Window  
- ➕ Signup Window  
- 🎉 Welcome Screen after successful login

## 📌 Note

- This project is for educational/demo purposes and does not use hashing or encryption. For production use, implement secure password hashing with libraries like `bcrypt` or `hashlib`.
